Game function

Primary game function, usually takes up the majority of a single turn. Calls a subcommand, attack(unit, unitType). Consists of an attack phase, a defense phase, and a saving phase.

Attack phase:
1. Requests a unit and unitType that is attacking.
2. Calls attack(unit, unitType).
    a. Checks if unitType is able to attack, if not, a value of 0 is returned.
    b. Checks if unti is hidden. If it is, it is revealed.
    c. Deals damage from 1 to the maximum perscribed by the unitType.
    d. Makes the unit immovable and unusable for the current turn.
    e. Returns the damage dealt.
3. The returned value is added to the total attack damage.
4. If the user desires to enter another unit, the loop repeats.
5. If the user proceeds to defense, the loop quits and the total attack damage is recorded.

Defense phase:
6. Requests a unit and unitType that is defending.
7. Calls attack(unit, unitType) (see above).
8. The retured value is added to the total defense damage.
9. If the user desires to enter another unit, the loop repeats.
10. If the user proceeds to saving, the loop quits and the total defense damage is recorded.

Saving phase:
11. If the user is quitting without saving, the function quits.
12. Requests the owner of the attacking units.
13. If the total attack damage is greater than the total defense damage, the damage dealt is equal to total attack minus total defense. Otherwise, damage dealt is 0.
14. The damage is dealt and recorded, and the function quits with an advisory to call the manual(kill) command if needed.s
