spy(unit, unitType)
Game function

1. Checks if the unitType has the ability to search. If not, the function throws an error and quits.
2. Randomly determines the search effectiveness between 1 and 6.
3. If the effectiveness is 6: tells the umpire to give good information, and calls details().
4. If the effectiveness is 1: tells the umpire to give wrong information, and calls details().
5. If the effectiveness is 2, 3, 4, or 5: tells the umpire to give no information.
6. Adds the unit to the usedUnits[] list.
