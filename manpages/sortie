sortie(unit, unitType)
Game function

Causes a unit to launch a sortie.

1. Checks if the unitType has the ability to launch sorties. If not, the function throws an error and quits.
2. Checks if the unit has already been used that turn, in which case the function throws an error and quits.
3. Deals damage equal to a random number between 1 and the maximum dictated by the unitType.
4. Adds the unit to the usedUnits[] and immobileUnits[] lists.
